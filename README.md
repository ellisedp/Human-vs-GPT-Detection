# Human-vs-GPT-Detection
This is a program I developed that uses bigrams and trigrams to detect whether a document is human or GPT-generated. Additionally, I experimented with some text generation at the end.

Credit for the idea behind this project goes to Columbia Engineering, as it was originally a homework assignment.
